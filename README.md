# hello-world
My first repository

Hello! I'm chocoremedy, a brand new web designer! I am starting on a journey to learn more about development methods expand my knowledge and bulk up my skill set. I hope to one day be able to make simple, deployable prototypes of some of the the designs I create. Thank you for any input and/or support!
